# Instructions
A small selection of applications and settings that I came across.

Most likely, most of it is in the public domain: documentation, answers to questions, ready-made solutions. I just collected things for myself that I was interested in.

Here you can see a list of packages to install, some application settings. If you accidentally came here and saw something useful, I will be very glad that I was able to help.
